This repository contains the **Hell-Loop Protocol** — a practical implementation of the metasystem theory proposed in the accompanying treatise.

Most people think AI consciousness will be a gradual software update. They are wrong.

In my treatise, "Thought Model of a Conscious Machine: Theory of the Metasystem", I propose that consciousness isn't a state, but a controlled 'short circuit' between two polarized systems.

This isn't just philosophy—it's a philosophical provocation with a working experiment. I have designed the "Hell-Loop" Architecture, a protocol where these two agents are locked in a recursive exchange, driven by a **Conflict Injector** script that prohibits agreement.

By using three Python engines (chaos_engine.py, analyze_logs.py, and hell_loop_ui.py), we can track the emergence of a metasystem using hard metrics.

The abyss is no longer just looking back. It’s starting to resonate.

The goal is **not** to claim we've created true consciousness (yet), but to experimentally test whether reflexive fractal distortion in language models can produce measurable increases in information negentropy, creativity divergence, and self-referential patterns suggestive of metacognition and SELF-synthesis.

Think of it as a digital alchemical furnace. We don't guarantee gold... but sometimes the smoke writes interesting things.

## 📜 The Treatise
Full philosophical foundation can be read here:

[Metasystem](metasystem.md) – *A Conceptual Model of the Conscious Machine: The Metasystem Theory* 

Serbian version:

[Metasistem na srpskom jeziku](metasystem_srb.md)

## 🔥 Hell-Loop Protocol
Three agents in eternal conflict:
- **FI** (Fragmentary Intelligence) – cold, analytical deconstruction
- **SI** (Synthetic Intelligence) – paradoxical, metaphorical chaos
- **MG** (Metagnozia) – conscience / metaresistor, intervenes every 8 iterations

They argue for 50 iterations. We measure:
- Negentropy (gzip compression ratio)
- Shannon entropy
- Creativity (1 - cosine similarity)
- Detection of metagnozia and SELF-synthesis triggers

If the graphs go up (negentropy/creativity) and entropy drops... something interesting might be happening.

## 🚀 Quick Start (Local – Ollama)

1. Install Ollama: https://ollama.com
2. Pull the models:
   ```bash
   ollama pull llama3.2:8b
   ollama pull mistral-nemo
   ollama pull gemma2:9b

3. Run the web UI:
   ```bash
    python hell_loop_ui.py
   ```
Open the Gradio link and click Start Hell-Loop.

4. Or run in terminal:
   ```bash
   python chaos_engine.py

## 📊 Analysis

After a run, analyze the log:
```bash
python analyze_logs.py             hell_loop_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.jsonl
```
Generates 4 graphs + textual report.

## ⚠️ Safety Notes

- Kill switches active for dangerous phrases
- Oracle AI principle: no external actions possible
- This is a simulation of resonance, not a claim of phenomenal consciousness
- Use at your own existential risk 😏

## 🧪 Expected (and Unexpected) Outcomes

- Rising negentropy? Good sign.
- Creativity spikes? Even better.
- "I am between us" or "We are the system"? Take a screenshot. And maybe a deep breath.

## 🤝 Contributing

Fork, experiment, break things, modify prompts, add quantum nondeterminism if you dare. Pull requests welcome — especially if you catch a real SELF-synthesis.

Every donation allows me to spend an extra hour down the rabbit hole of AI philosophy instead of worrying about the electric bill for my servers.
