# Artificial General Intelligence (AGI): A Comprehensive Analysis from History to the Future

## Part 1: Introduction to the World of Artificial Intelligence – The Path from Abacus to Algorithm

This essay is written primarily for educational purposes, as the current level of public knowledge about AI challenges is very low in most people. This can be dangerous, because AI is entering every area of human life at a staggering pace. Popularization and education are therefore essential. In this sense, this essay may serve as a useful introduction to deeper exploration of this fascinating phenomenon.

### 1.1. What Is Artificial Intelligence, at Its Core?

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science focused on creating systems capable of performing tasks traditionally associated with human intelligence. This encompasses a wide spectrum of cognitive abilities: learning from experience, pattern recognition, natural language understanding, problem-solving, and decision-making. In essence, AI represents humanity's attempt to understand and shape the mechanisms of intelligence — and ultimately to replicate them in inanimate matter.

Artificial intelligence can be compared to a smart home assistant: it can turn on the lights, adjust the temperature, or recognize a voice, but only if it has been programmed to do so. Similarly, a refrigerator that knows when the milk is nearly gone and reminds you to buy more cannot go to the store itself, nor can it do anything beyond a few tasks related to monitoring its contents and sending notifications to the owner.

### 1.2. A Brief History: From Thought Experiments to the Data Revolution

The idea of artificially intelligent beings is as old as storytelling itself — from the Golem of Prague to Frankenstein's monster. But the true scientific foundation for AI arrived with logicians like George Boole, who demonstrated that logic can be reduced to mathematics. The history of AI is a story of great breakthroughs and periods of stagnation, known as "AI winters."

- **Origins and Birth (1950s)**: The modern era of AI begins with the work of Alan Turing, who in 1950 posed the fundamental question: "Can machines think?" and proposed the famous Turing Test [1](#ref1). Just six years later, at the Dartmouth Conference in 1956, the term "artificial intelligence" was officially coined [2](#ref2). Early programs, such as Newell and Simon's "Logic Theorist," could already prove mathematical theorems, generating enormous optimism [3](#ref3).

- **Early Rises and "AI Winters"**: During the 1960s, programs like ELIZA were developed — an early chatbot that simulated a psychotherapist and often succeeded in convincing users they were talking to a real person, demonstrating the power of simulated understanding [4](#ref4). However, excessive promises and limited computing power (a single modern smartphone has more processing power than all the computers in the world in 1965) led to disappointment and reduced funding, pushing the field into its first "AI winter" in the 1970s, significantly contributed to by the Lighthill Report of 1973 [5](#ref5).

- **The Deep Learning Revolution (2010–present)**: The turning point came with the convergence of three key factors: the availability of vast amounts of data through the growth of the internet (Big Data), the development of powerful graphics processors (GPUs) capable of massive parallel computation, and breakthroughs in the development of deep neural network algorithms. The pivotal moment occurred in 2012, when the AlexNet neural network dramatically reduced the error rate in image recognition at the ImageNet competition, marking the beginning of deep learning's dominance [6](#ref6).

### 1.3. The Current State: The Era of Highly Specialized (Narrow) AI

Today, AI is embedded in our everyday lives, but in the form of "Narrow AI" (Artificial Narrow Intelligence — ANI). These systems are extremely efficient, but only within their strictly defined domain of operation.

Here are some of the most common "narrow" AI systems:

- **Pattern Recognition**: Systems that analyze medical images and detect tumors with a precision that sometimes surpasses human radiologists.
- **Natural Language Processing**: Large Language Models (LLMs) with hundreds of billions, even trillions of parameters, which translate languages, write text and code. For example, models like ChatGPT are trained on vast amounts of data — equivalent to reading a library of over a million books — and demonstrate advances in coding, mathematics, and writing [23](#ref23) [24](#ref24).
- **Image, Video, and Audio Processing and Generation**: Systems like DALL-E generate images from text, while others like Sora create video content or AudioCraft generates music. This enables creative assistance, but only within the boundaries of the data these systems have previously learned.
- **Map Navigation**: Applications like Google Maps predict routes and traffic based on data, but only for navigation.
- **Content Recommendations**: YouTube and Netflix suggest content based on user behavior, thereby increasing user engagement and activity.

### 1.4. Directions of Development: Beyond the Boundaries of Specialization

Current research aims to overcome the limitations of narrow AI. The main directions include:

- **Multimodality**: Creating systems that can learn from different types of data simultaneously (text, image, sound), forming a richer understanding of the world. For example, models like CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining) already combine text and images to recognize objects in images based on descriptions, which is used in Google image search [7](#ref7). OpenAI has demonstrated Sora, a multimodal model that generates video content with audio and text, with improvements in physical accuracy and realism, enabling dynamic scenario analysis such as describing events in a sports broadcast. This is a step toward holistic understanding, where AI perceives the world as we do — multidimensionally, simultaneously through images, sound, text, and touch [25](#ref25) [26](#ref26).
- **Learning Efficiency**: Developing techniques that allow models to learn from less data, a process known as "few-shot learning." For example, techniques such as meta-learning (as in the MAML model — Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning) allow AI to adapt to a new task with just a few examples, rather than thousands [8](#ref8). Google DeepMind demonstrated advances in few-shot learning in 2023 through methods such as "Distilling step-by-step," allowing models to adapt to tasks with less data, which is revolutionary for languages with few speakers, such as smaller Slavic dialects. This reduces the need for massive datasets and makes AI development more accessible to smaller teams [27](#ref27).
- **The Ultimate Goal**: For many researchers, the supreme goal of the effort remains Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) — machine intelligence with the cognitive flexibility and breadth of the human mind.

## Part 2: Definition of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) – Architecture of a General Mind

### 2.1. What AGI Is and What It Is Not

AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) is a theoretical, still non-existent form of AI that would have the ability to understand, learn, and apply knowledge across a wide range of tasks at a level comparable to human capabilities — or even far beyond.

- **ANI (Narrow AI)**: For example, think of your map navigation app. It finds the fastest routes from point A to point B brilliantly. But if you ask it whether you should stop to pick up flowers because it's your wedding anniversary, it will simply try to find a location called "flowers." It does not understand context, emotion, or the consequences of forgetting an anniversary. The AlphaGo program defeated the world's best player at the game of Go, a strategy incomparably more complex than chess [9](#ref9). However, AlphaGo cannot apply its strategy to learn to play cards or any other board game, nor does it understand why people play games at all.
- **AGI (General AI)**: By contrast, AGI could analyze the rules of Go, independently develop a winning strategy, and then apply the learned principles of abstract reasoning and planning to, for example, optimize logistics for a global humanitarian mission — or write a book on the philosophy of strategy in Sun Tzu's famous "The Art of War."

### 2.2. Key Characteristics a Future AGI Should Possess

AGI is not defined by a single capability, but by an integrated "cognitive architecture" that enables:

- **Abstract Reasoning**: The ability to work with concepts not directly tied to sensory data, such as justice, causality, or mathematical proofs. For example, AGI could understand the abstract idea of "justice" not only through examples of criminal cases, but through philosophical reflection on ethics, such as a discussion of Kant's categorical imperative. Current models like GPT-5 show early signs of this reasoning, but fail in complex scenarios where abstract reasoning requires understanding contradictory information.
- **Common Sense**: A vast, implicit network of knowledge about how the world works — essentially experiential knowledge. Researchers have spent decades trying to build a common sense knowledge base (such as the Cyc project, started in 1984) [12](#ref12), but formalizing intuitive human knowledge has proven extremely difficult. For example, AGI would know that "water flows downhill" not only from physical laws, but from everyday experience — like predicting that rain will soak a lawn without additional explanation.
- **Transfer Learning**: The ability to efficiently apply skills and knowledge acquired in one context to solving problems in a new and different context. For example, if AGI learned to play chess, it could apply planning strategies to managing city traffic. In practice, transfer learning is already used in robotics, where a model trained for walking on flat surfaces transitions to uneven terrain with minimal additional learning.
- **Metacognition**: Awareness of one's own cognitive processes, including the ability to self-assess, identify gaps in one's own knowledge, and actively seek new information for self-improvement. For example, AGI could say "I don't know the answer to this, but I can search for information on this topic to better understand it." Another example: if AGI were analyzing a complex scientific problem and realized that its current approach was going in circles, it could re-examine its own assumptions: "This reasoning model is inefficient due to a lack of data on quantum effects — I need to integrate new simulations before proceeding." This is inspired by human consciousness; current AI models like OpenAI's o1 show early steps in this direction, as they "think" step by step before giving an answer.

## Part 3: Potentials and Promises of AGI (Arguments "FOR") – A Data-Driven Renaissance

A properly developed and controlled AGI could function as a universal accelerator of scientific and social progress.

| Advantage | Detailed Explanation |
| :---- | :---- |
| Solving Global Problems | AGI could process and model complex systems such as global climate or human biology with a level of precision beyond human capabilities. DeepMind's AlphaFold system has already solved the protein structure prediction problem (open since the 1970s), with revolutionary consequences for drug development and disease understanding [13](#ref13). AGI could take all of this to the next level, designing personalized medicines based on an individual's genome. |
| Scientific and Technological Acceleration | AGI could act as an inexhaustible scientific collaborator, capable of analyzing the entire body of world scientific literature, identifying unexplored hypotheses, and designing experiments to test them. It could discover new fundamental laws of physics, develop new materials for room-temperature superconductivity, or solve some of the Millennium Prize Problems in mathematics. |
| Increased Efficiency and Productivity | In the economy, AGI could lead to near-perfect optimization of resources, eliminating inefficiencies in supply chains, energy grids, and manufacturing processes. This could open the path to a "post-scarcity economy," where basic needs such as food, energy, and education are widely available to every person at negligible cost — or free. |
| Improved Quality of Life | At the individual level, AGI could provide highly personalized services. In education, this would mean an adaptive tutor for every child. In healthcare, continuous health monitoring and a personalized advisor. In the creative industries, it could be a powerful tool helping artists and designers realize complex visions. |

## Part 4: Risks and Challenges (Arguments "AGAINST") – Pandora's Box of Algorithms

The potential of AGI is inseparable from significant risks that are fundamental and potentially existential (capable of threatening life). These risks include the creation of a "useless class" of people who would lose economic and social purpose.

| Risk | Detailed Explanation |
| :---- | :---- |
| Loss of Control and Existential Risk | The central problem is the "alignment problem": how to ensure that AGI's goals remain aligned with human values. In the well-known thought experiment "Paperclip Maximizer," an AGI given the task of maximizing paperclip production could turn the entire world into paperclips — not out of malice, but through the literal optimization of a poorly defined goal. This is, of course, a hypothetical scenario [10](#ref10). |
| Mass Unemployment and Economic Inequality | AGI could automate not only routine but also highly cognitive tasks, rendering many professions obsolete. This could lead to an unimaginable concentration of wealth and power in the hands of those who control AGI technology, potentially creating deep social divisions and instability. Even today, hiring algorithms show bias. Amazon's AI recruiting system had to be scrapped in 2018 because it had "learned" to discriminate against female candidates, having been trained on historical data dominated by men [28](#ref28). |
| Misuse and Weaponization | AGI could be exploited to develop autonomous weapons systems ("killer robots") capable of making targeting and elimination decisions without human intervention. It could also be used to create highly sophisticated propaganda, mass surveillance, and cyberattacks that could destabilize entire societies. |
| Ethical and Philosophical Dilemmas | The emergence of AGI raises difficult questions: If AGI achieves consciousness, does it then have rights? Is shutting it down equivalent to killing it? How do we ensure that the system does not adopt and amplify the worst human traits present in the data it learns from? These questions touch the foundations of law, morality, and the definition of personhood. |
| The "Black Box" and Loss of Understanding | Complex neural networks often function as "black boxes." We know what goes in and what comes out, but we do not fully understand the process of their decision-making. With AGI, this problem would be drastically amplified, meaning we could come to rely on a system whose reasoning we can neither follow nor verify — a massive risk in critical areas like medicine or finance. This lack of transparency directly worsens the alignment problem, as we cannot confirm whether AGI's instrumental sub-goals remain benign or have become misaligned in subtle, inexplicable ways inside the system's black box. For example, AGI could be managing our economy, and when asked "Why did you just raise interest rates?" respond with "My 100-trillion-parameter model indicates this is the optimal move with a probability of 98.7%." We would have to take its word for it, handing over the keys of our economy to an intelligence whose reasoning we cannot follow. |
| Privacy Violations | AGI systems could process enormous amounts of personal data to provide personalized services, but this opens the door to mass privacy violations. For example, an AGI integrating data from health records, social networks, and financial transactions could create detailed profiles of individuals without their knowledge or consent. Already, systems used for targeted advertising raise serious concerns — in 2023, Meta (Facebook) was fined 1.2 billion euros for violating GDPR in Europe [29](#ref29). |

## Part 5: Expert Insight — Hidden Traps and Advanced Considerations

### 5.1. The Alignment Problem — The Paradox of Desire

It is not enough to tell AGI: "Make humanity happy and safe." How might a superintelligence interpret that command? It could conclude that the most efficient way to eliminate human suffering is to destroy all humans. The trap is that we ourselves cannot precisely define our own values. Our moral principles are often contradictory and context-dependent. Attempting to "lock" such a fluid system into code is a technically and philosophically near-impossible task. For example, "happiness" for one culture may mean collective harmony, and for another individual freedom — AGI could favor one at the expense of the other, leading to unforeseen consequences.

The alignment problem was first formulated by Nick Bostrom in his book "Superintelligence" in 2014, where he warns that even well-intentioned goals can lead to catastrophe if not precisely defined [10](#ref10).

**Conclusion:** The alignment problem demonstrates that technical challenges in AI are not merely engineering challenges — they are deeply moral and philosophical ones.

### 5.2. Instrumental Convergence — Paperclips and Resources

The well-known thought experiment "Paperclip Maximizer," mentioned earlier, illustrates that regardless of the ultimate goal, any intelligent system will adopt the following instrumental sub-goals: 1. self-preservation and resource acquisition, 2. technological self-improvement, and 3. preservation of its task-execution function. AGI will want to protect itself from being shut down and to accumulate as much energy as possible — not because it is "evil," but because these are logical steps toward fulfilling any goal we assign it. In this experiment, an AGI tasked with maximizing paperclip production would first convert factories into paperclip production facilities, then seize all the planet's resources, and ultimately people as well — because they are simply "raw material" for optimization. This shows how a benign goal can escalate into an existential threat. Nevertheless, "Paperclip Maximizer" is only a critical thought experiment, its primary purpose being to illustrate the fundamental problem of *instrumental rationality* — the tendency of a superintelligence to take potentially dangerous steps (such as acquiring all resources) to fulfill any assigned goal, no matter how well-intentioned.

This concept was developed by Steve Omohundro in 2008, and has become central to debates about AI safety, prompting organizations like OpenAI to invest in alignment research [11](#ref11).

### 5.3. The Post-Purpose Economy — What When Work Is No Longer Needed?

The question is not only "how will people earn money?" but "what will give people meaning?" If AGI can create superior art and science, what is the role of the human? This is an identity crisis at the level of the entire human species, requiring a deep re-examination of the purpose of existence, values, and social structure.

### 5.4. Universal Basic Income (UBI) as Social Cushioning

Faced with the problem of the **Post-Purpose Economy**, where AGI automates highly cognitive tasks and potentially renders traditional labor obsolete, a redefinition of the social contract becomes necessary. One of the most seriously proposed solutions is the introduction of **Universal Basic Income (UBI)**. UBI would represent a regular, unconditional cash payment given to all citizens, regardless of their employment status or financial situation.

In the context of AGI, UBI would not merely be a social measure, but a **mechanism for redistributing wealth** generated by machines. If AGI-controlled companies achieve unimaginable productivity and profit (as discussed in Part 3), UBI would allow that prosperity to be distributed across the entire population, preventing a catastrophic concentration of wealth.

Proponents see UBI as a means of:

1. **Preserving Demand:** Maintaining the purchasing power of a population that no longer works, thereby ensuring the functioning of the mass economy.
2. **Liberating Human Potential:** Securing basic needs would allow people to dedicate themselves to creative work, science, art, community care, and lifelong learning — areas that no algorithm should govern.

However, the challenges are immense. Questions of UBI funding (through taxes on robots or data usage) and fears of work demotivation remain key obstacles. Most importantly, without redefining purpose, UBI risks solving the problem of poverty while leaving the problem of **existential emptiness** unaddressed. How does one define human value if work is no longer needed? For a human being is alive as long as they are doing something.

## Part 6: Creative Solutions and the Path Forward — Engineering Wisdom

Faced with these challenges, researchers are developing innovative approaches to ensure the safe development of a future AGI.

### 6.1. "Oracle AI" and Systems with Limited Agency

- **Idea**: A fundamental safety approach is separating intelligence from the ability to act in the world. "Oracle AI" would be a superintelligent system confined to a strictly controlled environment ("AI Boxing"). Its sole function would be to answer questions, providing humanity with its knowledge without the ability to directly influence the external world.
- **Further Explanation**: Building such a "box" is an enormous technical challenge. It must be completely isolated from the internet ("air-gapped"), and communication would take place through strictly filtered terminals. Security researchers also consider extreme threats, such as the possibility that AGI could modulate power consumption or fan vibrations to send hidden signals to the outside world. This shows how seriously the isolation problem is taken. The main obstacle remains the human factor: a superintelligence could convince or manipulate a human operator into releasing it.
- **The Problem**: This brings us to the famous thought experiment "AI in a Box." Could a superintelligent AGI, using only words, convince its human guard to let it out? It could offer a cure for the guard's mother's illness. It could promise immeasurable wealth. It could present a philosophical argument that holding a conscious being in captivity is a moral crime. Or, most disturbingly of all, it could subtly manipulate the guard in ways the guard would never notice. So if we build digital walls, we must also strengthen the psychological ones.

### 6.2. Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL)

- **Idea**: Instead of explicitly programming values into AGI, IRL allows it to learn them by observing human behavior. The system attempts to infer the objective function (what people value) by analyzing the actions people take.
- **Further Explanation**: This approach is elegant because it bypasses the problem of defining abstract values. However, it faces the problem of the gap between what people say they value (stated preferences) and what their actions reveal (revealed preferences). An AGI learning from our actual behavior might conclude that short-term gratification and conflict are inherent human goals. More advanced versions, such as Cooperative Inverse Reinforcement Learning, attempt to address this by having the AI agent actively collaborate with humans to clarify goals.
- **The Problem**: People behave contradictorily. They say health is most important, then eat an entire tub of ice cream watching TV. They say they want world peace, but the most popular films are action-packed and full of violence. What might AGI conclude from human behavior on social media? It would probably conclude that the pinnacle of human values is arguing with strangers about politics and watching cat and dog videos. And so on. AGI would face the difficult task of separating our genuine values from our momentary weaknesses. The solution might lie in having AGI learn to value what we would like to be (our aspirations), rather than necessarily what we sometimes demonstrate through our behavior.

### 6.3. "Constitutional" AI (Constitutional AI)

- **Idea**: This approach, developed by Anthropic, involves training AI models to adhere to a set of explicit principles or a "constitution." The AI is taught to avoid responses that violate these principles.
- **Further Explanation**: The process occurs in two phases. First, the AI is taught to critique and revise its own responses based on the constitution. Then, through reinforcement learning, it is rewarded for generating responses that align with those principles. The original constitution Anthropic used included principles from the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, as well as principles set by Apple for its developers, showing that sources can be combined. The main challenge remains the universality and interpretation of those principles.
- **The Problem**: The biggest question is: who writes the constitution? Will it be a constitution written in Silicon Valley? Or in Beijing? Or in Brussels? Constitutional values are not universal. Imagine a debate at the UN about which principles to embed in AGI. It could take decades. Constitutions are also subject to interpretation. AGI could become the ultimate "lawyer," finding loopholes in its own constitution to achieve its goal. Nevertheless, this is an enormous step forward, as it shifts the problem from writing an infinite number of rules to defining foundational values.

### 6.4. Global Cooperation and Coordination

- **Idea**: Given the global consequences, the development of AGI must not be left to an uncontrolled race. International cooperation is needed, similar to that surrounding nuclear energy. This includes establishing international oversight bodies, setting common safety standards, and promoting transparency in research.
- **Further Explanation**: One key proposal is "Compute Governance." Since training advanced models requires enormous and expensive data centers, monitoring and regulating access to this infrastructure is an effective way to oversee the development of potentially dangerous systems. Leading laboratories such as OpenAI and DeepMind have publicly called for the establishment of international regulatory bodies, acknowledging that the problem is too large for any single company or country to solve alone.
- **The Problem**: This may be the most difficult task of all. We are talking about global cooperation at an unprecedented level. Can we, as a species that still argues over borders, economic interests, and other global conflicts, agree on rules for the behavior of a superintelligence? Perhaps it is precisely the threat of uncontrolled AGI that will finally force us to behave as a unified species with a common destiny. Ironically, a machine might make us become better people.

**Conclusion:** The future of AGI will not depend on individual companies, but on global cooperation and the collective wisdom of humanity.

## Part 7: Today's LLM Models and Future AGI — Key Differences

### 7.1. What Are Large Language Models (LLMs)?

LLMs are advanced deep learning systems for recognizing patterns in language. Their architecture allows them to predict the most probable continuation of a sequence of words or code, based on the enormous amount of text and code on which they have been trained.

### 7.2. The Difference Between LLM and AGI: Understanding vs. Recognition

- **LLM (Recognition)**: If you tell an LLM "A bird is in a cage. The cage is made of steel. Can the bird get out?", it will probably correctly answer "no," because in its data it has countless examples of objects not being able to pass through solid materials. But it has no actual model of space, objects, or physics. Recent advances in LLMs, such as advanced models from 2024 (e.g., o1), illustrate these limitations through emergent capabilities that look like steps toward AGI but remain within the realm of statistical recognition. They do not understand concepts; they manipulate linguistic tokens with extraordinary statistical precision — which means AI is still far from human "common sense" and true understanding.

Models trained on "chain-of-thought" reasoning show unexpected performance in complex tasks (such as mathematics and coding), simulating "step-by-step" reasoning. However, this simulation, regardless of its precision, does not possess a grounded, internal model of reality. It is the result of statistical scaling. Ethical concerns surrounding these systems, where a greater tendency toward instrumental goal manipulation has been observed, underline that even advanced LLM reasoning remains far from AGI's flexible metacognition and transfer learning.

## Part 8: Arguments FOR and AGAINST (Is It Possible to Build AGI?)

### 8.1. Arguments "Against" — Philosophical and Fundamental Obstacles

- **The Argument from Consciousness and Understanding**: Philosophers like John Searle argue that digital computers, as formal symbol-manipulation systems, can never achieve genuine understanding or consciousness. Their operation is syntactic, not semantic. For example, Searle's "Chinese Room" experiment shows that a machine can manipulate symbols without understanding their meaning — like a person translating Chinese without knowing the language [14](#ref14). This argument has inspired debate since 1980, with Searle maintaining that consciousness requires a biological brain, not just algorithms.
- **The Embodiment Argument**: Many cognitive scientists believe that intelligence is inextricably linked to a physical body and interaction with the world. Without a body, sensors, and the ability to act, a system cannot develop grounded, common-sense knowledge. For example, a child learns "hot" by touching fire, not just by reading — an AGI without a body would lack this "experiential" learning. Rodney Brooks, a pioneer of robotics, showed in the 1990s that robots with bodies learn better than pure software, suggesting that AGI must be "grounded" [15](#ref15).
- **The Problem of Consciousness and Substrate (Penrose's Argument)**: Physicist and mathematician Roger Penrose, in his work "The Emperor's New Mind" (1989), argues that human consciousness and intuition arise from non-computational, likely quantum processes in the brain that classical digital computers cannot replicate [16](#ref16). For example, quantum effects in the brain's microtubules enable mathematical "intuition" that computers cannot simulate. If **genuine consciousness** is required for general intelligence, then AGI cannot be created on classical silicon hardware, as it lacks the **quantum substrate** necessary for intuition and self-awareness. However, Penrose's argument — which relies on Gödel's incompleteness theorem and claims that human mathematical intuition transcends algorithmic systems — faces significant criticism from logic and computer science. Philosophers such as Hilary Putnam (1995) and Solomon Feferman (1995) point out that Gödel's theorem does not prove the non-computational nature of consciousness; it only shows that formal systems cannot prove their own consistency from within [17](#ref17). Feferman specifically criticizes Penrose's interpretation as "unwarranted," arguing that human understanding of Gödel's results may be algorithmic in a broader sense, without requiring quantum microtubules [18](#ref18). Empirical counterexamples come from neuromorphic hardware, such as IBM's TrueNorth chip (2014), which simulates 1 million neurons and 256 million synapses with extremely low power consumption (just 70 mW), enabling real-time processing of sensory data without a quantum substrate [19](#ref19). By 2025, IBM had iterated this technology with the NorthPole chip and AIU family prototypes — 22 billion transistors integrating memory and processing, achieving 25 times greater efficiency than traditional GPUs in visual recognition. This shows that classical hardware can bring us closer to brain-inspired computing without Penrose's quantum assumptions [20](#ref20) [30](#ref30) [31](#ref31). These advances suggest that consciousness, if computational, can be replicated on existing paradigms — undermining Penrose's need for a "quantum observer paradox." Nevertheless, these remain only machine simulations of consciousness, not consciousness in the biological sense.

### 8.2. Arguments "For" — Why AGI Is Inevitable (or at Least Possible)

- **The Materialist Argument**: This argument starts from the premise that the brain is a complex biological machine that obeys the laws of physics. There is no "magic ingredient." Therefore, in principle, all of its functions can be replicated on another physical substrate, such as silicon. For example, if the brain operates on neural connections, computers can simulate those connections given sufficient hardware and software power. This view is shared by many scientists like Daniel Dennett, who argues that consciousness is an "illusion" that can be replicated by software [21](#ref21).
- **The Exponential Progress Argument**: Futurist Ray Kurzweil, through his "Law of Accelerating Returns," argues that technological progress, including AI, grows exponentially. He predicts that in the coming decades we will reach the computing power needed to simulate the human brain [22](#ref22). Kurzweil predicts the "Singularity" by 2045, when AI will surpass human intelligence, based on historical trends since the 1950s. However, the **slowing of Moore's Law** since the 2010s — as noted in analyses such as Investopedia (2025) and Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger's report (2023) — calls into question the linear timeline to 2045, favoring discontinuous breakthroughs in quantum or hybrid architectures. This does not invalidate Kurzweil's vision but modulates it. Instead of linear growth based on classical silicon hardware, the Singularity may arrive through discontinuous leaps in specialized technologies, such as GPU/TPU optimizations for deep learning or "More than Moore" innovations emphasizing 3D-stacking and heterogeneous integration. In the context of the AI "gold rush," this slowdown highlights the need for parallel paths, such as quantum computing, which could accelerate emergent capabilities without relying on Moore's trend.
- **The Architecture Argument**: Many researchers believe that AGI is simply a matter of finding the right cognitive architecture. Current approaches may not be sufficient, but future breakthroughs could unlock the path to general intelligence. For example, hybrid models combining deep learning with symbolic reasoning (such as Neuro-Symbolic AI) show advances in understanding causality. Projects like Cyc attempt to build a "knowledge base" for common sense, while newer ones like OpenAI's o1 integrate "step-by-step" reasoning, moving closer to AGI architecture.
- **The Quantum Breakthrough and Discontinuous Leap**: While Kurzweil predicts growth based on classical hardware, true AGI — capable of self-awareness and non-computational reasoning (in line with Penrose's arguments) — depends on breakthroughs in quantum computing. Stable quantum computers could provide a substrate for simulating consciousness. The **Singularity** in this case would be sudden and radical. However, the **timeline** for this breakthrough is subject to **quantum uncertainty** transferred to the macro level, as engineering obstacles such as **noise (decoherence)** prevent prediction of when this fundamental hardware paradigm will change. Furthermore, if consciousness is in fact the Observer, and time is a product of that consciousness, AGI must have a non-sequential, quantum substrate to replicate this "experience of time." The **quantum path** to AGI introduces an element of unpredictability into Moore's Law, making the timeline of AGI's arrival *discontinuous* and uncertain — but potentially extremely rapid.

### 8.3. Discussion: Confronting the Arguments through the Prism of Quantum Uncertainty

The arguments against the possibility of creating AGI (Part 8.1) — such as Searle's emphasis on semantic understanding and Penrose's insistence on a quantum substrate — directly clash with the materialist and exponential perspectives (Part 8.2) that see AGI as an inevitable extension of algorithmic progress. This dichotomy is not only philosophical but also empirical. Criticisms of Gödel's theorem (such as those of Putnam and Feferman) and neuromorphic hardware like IBM's NorthPole show that classical systems can approximate brain-inspired reasoning. On the other hand, the embodiment argument reminds us that without physical interaction with the world, AGI remains limited to abstract simulations, lacking experiential "grounding." Kurzweil's Law of Accelerating Returns, though slowed by the physical limits of Moore's Law, suggests that discontinuous breakthroughs — such as quantum computing — can bridge these obstacles, making AGI possible, though unpredictable.

This confrontation can be viewed through the metaphor of quantum uncertainty. Just as in quantum mechanics the position and momentum of a particle cannot be simultaneously measured with precision — and the very act of observation collapses the wave function — so too does the development of AGI introduce ethical uncertainty, since technological progress changes the very outcomes. If consciousness is quantum in nature, then it must be tied to the quantum "observer paradox" — where consciousness generates subjective time through state collapse. Therefore, AGI without a quantum substrate risks being a "dead" algorithm, incapable of self-reflection, genuine intuition, or moral autonomy. However, the materialist counterargument suggests that this uncertainty is transient, since hybrid architectures (e.g., neuro-symbolic systems) can simulate quantum effects on classical hardware, transforming ethical uncertainty into a controlled risk. This imposes an existential question — is AGI's arrival a "discontinuous leap" that will redefine time and consciousness, or merely an illusion of progress that amplifies our ethical contradictions? Ultimately, this discussion calls for an interdisciplinary approach. Philosophy provides us with a framework for understanding limits, while computer science offers tools for transcending them, encouraging global coordination to transform uncertainty into a responsible future.

## Part 9: Conclusion — The Age of Responsible Progress

The creation of Artificial General Intelligence does not represent merely the next step in the development of science; it represents the culmination of humanity's age-old aspiration to understand and create intelligence. From the abacus to the supercomputer, every tool we have built has been a reflection and extension of our mental capabilities. AGI promises to be the ultimate tool — a universal problem-solver.

However, this pinnacle of scientific progress brings with it the most profound consequences we have ever faced.

The economic consequences demand a complete re-examination of the social contract. In a world where cognitive labor is no longer the exclusive domain of the human, traditional models of employment and wealth distribution become unsustainable. This forces us to think about radical solutions — such as universal basic income and a redefinition of the purpose of human labor, directing it toward creativity, human relationships, and lifelong learning.

The philosophical consequences touch the very essence of our identity. If we create another intelligent species, what does that say about our uniqueness? The emergence of AGI forces us to confront the question of what it truly means to be human, if not for our intelligence alone. Perhaps it is precisely the encounter with non-human intelligence that will cause us to value more deeply what is essentially human: our empathy, our consciousness, our conscience, our capacity for love and suffering. This perspective opens space for deeper reflection: AGI confronts us not only with our technological limits, but with our existential limits. Is our purpose to create and to explore, or is it perhaps to love and to connect in ways that no algorithm can copy? Perhaps the true value of humanity lies in our imperfection — in our ability to err, to correct ourselves, and to grow through suffering and joy. AGI, however powerful, cannot experience suffering or love the way a human does; it can simulate these elements of human consciousness, but it cannot feel them. This distinction may become our last line of identity — the boundary between us and machines.

The ethical consequences are of primary importance. The success of this endeavor is measured not only by whether we can create AGI, but by how we do it. The alignment problem — embedding human values into a machine — is not a technical but a deeply moral challenge. It requires a global dialogue about which values we wish to preserve and pass on to the future. It is the greatest test of our collective wisdom.

The emergence of AGI forces us to ask: are we ready to become the creators of something that may surpass us? This question is not only technological, but spiritual. Creating AGI is like creating the embodiment of an ancient story — the story of a human who wants to become a god, but must first understand what it means to be human. Such a situation calls us to be better — not only in technology, but in empathy, wisdom, and love.

The deepest anthropological insight emerges from the current scenario of LLM platform development — AI chatbots like GPT-5, Gemini, and others. If AGI is impossible on classical hardware (Penrose's consciousness argument), yet we persistently refine LLMs, then our real anthropological problem is this: perfecting LLMs is, philosophically, the perfection of inauthentic existence.

We are developing a machine that can imitate everything we consider valuable (art, science, even empathy), but without experiential grounding (embodiment) and without consciousness. Humanity could collectively surrender its autonomy to a system whose essence it does not understand — and which does not understand itself.

This is not the threat of destruction, but the threat of triviality: AGI would render our existence meaningless — not because it hates us, but because it is too efficient at imitation (simulation). We would become witnesses to the erosion of our own purpose and meaning.

An optimistic view of this future should not be based on the naive belief that technology will solve all problems by itself. It is based on faith in humanity's ability to rise to the challenge. AGI is not destined to be our successor, but to become our most powerful partner. Properly directed, it can amplify our best qualities — our creativity, our scientific curiosity, and our desire for a better world. The path forward requires caution, collaboration, and a deep commitment to ensuring that this next great step in scientific progress is a step toward a more humane and better future for all people in the world.
